Welcome to the MOD_WSGI project

In order to have got here you must have checked out all code for the
mod_wsgi project from the trunk of the mod_wsgi source code repository.

At present the only code which has been made publically available is the
mod_wsgi adapter module for Apache. Over time other companion products
will however be added. These extra products will provide additional
features for using Python in conjunction with Apache, enabling you to
make even more powerful web applications using the Apache web server.
