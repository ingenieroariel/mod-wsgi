Welcome to the MOD_WSGI project

Copyright 2007 GRAHAM DUMPLETON

In order to have got here you must have checked out all code for the
mod_wsgi project from the trunk of the mod_wsgi source code repository.

The sub packages contained within this directory are as follows:

mod_wsgi - The core Apache module for hosting Python WSGI applications
in conjunction with the Apache web server.

ap_swig_py - SWIG bindings for the internal Apache web server APIs.

Note that the only package you need for hosting Python web applications
which implement the WSGI interface is the mod_wsgi package. The other
packages provided here are optional and would only be used by developers
writing Python web applications which specifically need to interact with
the Apache web server.

Any official releases of the above packages and corresponding documentation
can be found at 'http://www.modwsgi.org'.
